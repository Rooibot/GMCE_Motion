# Basic Motion Matching / Motion Warping Example Plugin

To use this, check the repository out into the `Plugins` directory of the GMAS + GMCEx template project. Once you've either loaded the template project or created a project from it, go to the `/Plugins/GMCE_Motion/Maps` folder and open `MotionMatchTestMap`; if you don't see the plugins contents, you may need to go to the settings for your Content Browser and select "Show Plugin Content" in the options.

**You must use the `motion-matching` branch of the template, currently.** This requires a number of changes -- both to the default template and to GMAS and GMCEx -- which have not been fully vetted and brought live yet.

Not everything in this project is 100% clean; the turn-in-place logic could be improved, the motion matching animation blueprint C++ parent class could be tidied up considerably, etc. But I think it's enough that folks can start poking at it, and tinker with improvements on their own. :)
